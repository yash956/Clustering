Clustering for Mall Customer Segmentation
Introduction
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.
Companies employing customer segmentation operate under the fact that every customer is different and that their marketing efforts would be better served if they target specific, smaller groups with messages that those consumers would find relevant and lead them to buy something. Companies also hope to gain a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences and needs with the idea of discovering what each segment finds most valuable to more accurately tailor marketing materials toward that segment.

Customer segmentation relies on identifying key differentiators that divide customers into groups that can be targeted. Information such as a customers' demographics (age, race, religion, gender, family size, ethnicity, income, education level), geography (where they live and work), psychographic (social class, lifestyle and personality characteristics) and behavioral (spending, consumption, usage and desired benefits) tendencies are taken into account when determining customer segmentation practices.

Benefits of customer segmentation include:

1.Personalisation
  Personalisation ensures that you provide exceptional customer experience.
2.Customer Retention
  It is 16 times as costly to build a long-term business relationship with a new customer than simply to cultivate the loyalty of an existing customer.
3.Better ROI for marketing
  Affirmations that right marketing messages are sent to the right people based on their life cycle stage.
4.Reveal new opportunities
  Customer segmentation may reveal new trends about products and it may even give the first moverâ€™s advantage in a product segment.
